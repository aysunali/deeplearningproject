# Japanese-English Neural Machine Translation

This project includes fine-tuning of a transformer translation model with JESC dataset which contains text from subtitles, aiming to create an improved version of japanese translation that includes colloquial language. 

Unfortunately the fine-tuned model was lost due to me missing the important step of saving it during cell calls. However the project can be used as an example, I have also included the steps for saving the model so no need to worry about that.
